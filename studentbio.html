      <p>I was born in a little known country call alooabad. I moved to england in 2010. I completed my early schooling in a public school and attended grammar school for my 'A' levels. I completed my degree in pure physics at the University of London. I worked for IBM as a senior consultant specialising in CRM. After long absence from IT, I am now attending this Bootcamp to re-skill and join the software industry as a competant engineer.</p>
